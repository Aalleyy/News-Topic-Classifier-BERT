# 📰 News Topic Classifier Using BERT

This project fine-tunes a `bert-base-uncased` transformer model on the AG News dataset to classify news headlines into one of four categories:

-  World
-  Sports
-  Business
-  Science/Technology

---

## Demo
 [Live Gradio App](#)  
_(Link will be available after deploying in Kaggle or locally with `share=True`)_

---

## Project Objectives

- Fine-tune a pretrained BERT model using Hugging Face Transformers
- Classify news headlines from the AG News dataset
- Evaluate model performance using Accuracy and F1-score
- Deploy using Gradio for real-time predictions

---

## Dataset

**AG News**  
- 120,000 training samples  
- 7,600 test samples  
- Labels: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech

Dataset source: Hugging Face Datasets  

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
load_dataset("ag_news")
```

## Tech Stack

- BERT from 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers

- AG News from Hugging Face Datasets

- PyTorch for model training

- Gradio for UI deployment

## Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy: 0.94

F1-Score (weighted): 0.94
